# Protein Sequence Analysis Using Python

## Overview
This project performs a computational analysis of protein sequences to study
sequence length variation and amino acid composition using Python.

## Research Objective
To understand how protein sequences differ in length and amino acid distribution
and how computational tools can be used to analyze biological data.

## Data
Protein sequences in FASTA format representing different biological proteins.
The workflow is directly applicable to large-scale datasets such as UniProt.

## Methodology
- Parsed FASTA-formatted protein sequences
- Computed sequence lengths
- Calculated amino acid frequency distribution
- Visualized results using matplotlib

## Results
- Protein lengths vary significantly depending on biological function
- Certain amino acids occur more frequently across proteins
- Computational analysis reveals patterns useful for biological interpretation

## Tools Used
- Python
- matplotlib
- Standard data structures (Counter)

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of computational techniques to analyze
biological data and highlights the role of programming in modern life science
research.
